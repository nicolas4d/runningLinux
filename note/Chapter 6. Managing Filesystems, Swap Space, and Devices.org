You probably created filesystems and swap space when you first installed Linux
(most distributions help you do the basics). Here is a chance to fine-tune these
resources. Most of the time, you do these things shortly after installing your
operating system, before you start loading up your disks with fun stuff. But
occasionally you will want to change a running system, in order to add a new
device or perhaps upgrade the swap space when you upgrade your RAM.
