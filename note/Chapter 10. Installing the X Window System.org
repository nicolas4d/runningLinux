  We come now to the X Window System — one of the most powerful and important
  software packages available for Linux. If you've ever used X on a Unix system
  before, you're in luck; running X under Linux is almost no different from
  running it under Unix systems. And, if you've never had the occasion to use it
  before, never fear: salvation is at hand.

  It's difficult to describe the X Window System in a nutshell. X is a complete
  windowing graphics interface for Unix systems. It provides a huge number of
  options to both the programmer and the user. For instance, at least half a
  dozen window managers are available for X, each one offering a different
  interface for manipulating windows. By customizing the attributes of the
  window manager, you have complete control over how windows are placed on the
  screen, the colors and borders used to decorate them, and so forth.

  Even if you have not heard about the X Window System yet, you may already have
  heard about KDE and GNOME. These are so-called desktop environments that
  provide a user-friendly work environment for your daily Linux work. We'll
  cover these in great detail in the next chapter.

  X was originally developed by Project Athena at MIT and Digital Equipment
  Corporation. The current version of X is Version 11 revision 6 (X11R6), which
  was first released in April 1994. Since the release of Version 11, X has
  virtually taken over as the de facto standard for Unix graphical environments.

  Despite its commercial use, the X Window System remains distributable under a
  liberal license from the X Consortium. As such, a complete implementation of X
  is freely available for Linux systems. XFree86, an implementation of X
  originally for i386 Unix systems, is the version that Linux uses most often.
  Today, this version supports not only Intel-based systems, but also Alpha AXP,
  MicroSPARC, PowerPC, and other architectures. Further architectures will
  follow. XFree86 is based on X386-1.2, which was part of the official X11R5
  sources, but is no longer maintained and is therefore outdated. The current
  versions now have very little in common with their ancestors. Support for
  innumerable graphics boards and many other operating systems (including Linux)
  has been added — and XFree86 implements the latest version, X11R6.3.

  We should mention here that commercial X Window System servers are available
  for Linux that may have advantages over XFree86 (like support for certain
  video cards). Most people use XFree86 happily, though, so this should
  certainly be your first stop.

  Linux distributions usually automatically install X. If you're lucky, you
  won't need this chapter at all. But a few users aren't lucky — the
  distribution doesn't recognize some graphics hardware, writes a file to the
  wrong location so that the X server can't start up, or has some other problem.
  One of the big advantages of this book is that we take you down to the depths
  of X configuration so that you can get it running no matter what your
  distribution does. You may not need to read this chapter, but if you do need
  it, you'll appreciate everything that's here.

  One word of advice: if you plan to run your Linux machine as a server only,
  there is no need to install X on it (unless you want to use graphical
  administration tools). X requires system resources, and if your system never
  has a monitor attached to it, installing X is a waste of time and resources.
  In this chapter, we will tell you how to install and configure the X Window
  System, and in the next chapter, we will explore how to use X.
