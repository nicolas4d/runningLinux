Before running X applications, it's a good idea to learn the rudiments of X
customization so that you're not forced to live with the (often unappealing)
default configuration used on many systems. Note that the next few sections do
not usually apply to the aforementioned desktop environments, which have more
user-friendly, GUI-based ways to configure applications and the environment.
It's still good to know the old-fashioned way of configuring things because you
are likely to come across applications that still follow this scheme.
