  Now that most of the world uses WYSIWYG word processors, and several good ones
  are available even for Linux, why use the anachronistic-looking text
  processors described in this section? Actually, text processing (especially in
  the form of XML) is the wave of the future. People will desire WYSIWYG
  interfaces, but they will demand a simple, standard, text format underneath to
  make their documents portable while allowing an unlimited range of automated
  tools to manipulate the documents.

  Because the tools described here are open source and widely available, you can
  use one of their formats without guilt and reasonably expect your readers to
  have access to formatters. You can also use an impressive range of tools
  developed over the years to handle these formats and do sophisticated
  processing for you, such as to develop a bibliography in T E X. Finally,
  filters have been developed (although they don't always work perfectly) to
  convert documents between each of these formats and other popular formats,
  including the formats used by commercial word processors. So you're not
  totally locked in, although you will probably have to exert some manual effort
  to accomplish an accurate conversion.

  In the first chapter, we briefly mentioned various text processing systems
  available for Linux and how they differ from word processing systems that you
  may be familiar with. While most word processors allow the user to enter text
  in a WYSIWYG environment, text processing systems have the user enter source
  text using a text-formatting language, which can be modified with any text
  editor. (In fact, Emacs provides special modes for editing various types of
  text-formatting languages.) Then, the source is processed into a printable (or
  viewable) document using the text processor itself. Finally, you process the
  output and send it to a file or to a viewer application for display, or you
  hand it off to a printer daemon to queue for printing to a local or remote
  device.

  In this section, we'll talk first about WYSIMWYG
  (what-you-see-is-maybe-what-you-get) word processors like those that
  predominate on Windows and the Macintosh. After that, we'll discuss some of
  the most popular text processing systems for Linux: T E X, SGML, groff, and
  Texinfo.
