After reading the previous three chapters, you now have all the skills you need
to start using your system. But eventually you'll want the information in this
chapter too. Some of the activities, such as making backup tapes, are important
habits to develop. You may also find it useful to have access to files and
programs on MS-DOS and Windows. Finally, we'll help you handle events that you
hope will never happen, but sometimes do â€” system panics and corruption.
