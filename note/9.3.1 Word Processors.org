  One obvious sign that Linux has come of age is that many popular WYSIWYG word
  processing systems are available for it today. For some time, it had even been
  rumored that Microsoft was going to port its office suite to Linux, but this
  is not likely to happen. A Microsoft suite is not really needed any longer
  anyway because you can get other quite good word processors.

  Another option is to use *Anyware Office* by VistaSource, Inc. Anyware Office
  is an office suite that is commercially made but inexpensive for Linux. It
  includes not only a word processor, but also a spreadsheet, a drawing program,
  a mail program, and other smaller tools. In some respects, Anyware Office
  behaves differently from word processors like Microsoft Word or WordPerfect,
  but once you get used to it, it can be quite useful and handy. Especially
  noteworthy is its support for importing and exporting FrameMaker documents.
  The development seems to have stopped somewhat, though, and it is uncertain
  what will become of this product.

  Sun Microsystems provides its office productivity suite *StarOffice* on a
  number of platforms, including Linux. It was open sourced a while ago and is
  now maintained in two branches: the commercial StarOffice one which you can
  purchase from Sun, and the freely available OpenOffice one which you can
  download from http://www.openoffice.org. Both are supposed to be mostly
  functionally identical, but OpenOffice may not have all the bells and whistles
  (like templates, clipart, etc.) that StarOffice has. OpenOffice is released
  under the GPL, so if you fancy reading through the 3 million lines of source
  code making up an office productivity suite, this would be an opportunity for
  you.

  *OpenOffice* is huge, so if you have a slow connection to the Net, check first
  whether your distribution doesn't already contain it.

  In addition, there is *KWord*, the word processor of the office productivity
  suite of the KDE desktop environment, KOffice. KWord has made a lot of
  progress lately. It sports an interesting frame concept that makes it suitable
  even for some desktop publishing tasks. Of course, you can also write your
  letter to grandma with it. You can find more information about it at
  http://www.kde.org.

  Finally, a good and lightweight alternative is *AbiWord*, more information
  about which you can find at http://www.abiword.org.

  All those programs have one feature in common that many consider a key
  requirement for doing office-type work on Linux: they can import Microsoft
  Word documents quite well. While you may well decide, as a new Linux
  enthusiast, that you won't accept documents sent to you in proprietary
  formats, sometimes they come from your boss, and you can't refuse to read them
  just because you are running Linux. In this case, it is good to know that
  Linux- based solutions are available.

  The LyX package (also available as KLyX with a more modern user interface) is
  another alternative. It provides a decent WYSIWYG X user interface that works
  with window managers from standard Linux distributions and uses the L A T E X
  and T E X packages in order to format the text for printing. If you can live
  with the formatting limits of the package (most of us can), you may find that
  LyX/KLyX is an excellent solution. LyX/KLyX does not know how to display some
  of the powerful formatting features that T E X provides, so if you are a power
  T E X user, this isn't for you. LyX/KLyX isn't part of most Linux
  distributions; to try it you will have to get it from a Linux archive.
