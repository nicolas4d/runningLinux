  In this section, we're going to cover the use of the vi (pronounced "vee-eye")
  text editor. vi was the first real screen-based editor for Unix systems. It is
  also simple, small, and sleek. If you're a system administrator, learning vi
  can be invaluable; in many cases, larger editors, such as Emacs, won't be
  available in emergency situations (for instance, when booting Linux from a
  maintenance disk).

  vi is based on the same principles as many other Unix applications: that each
  program provide a small, specific function and be able to interact with other
  programs. For example, vi doesn't include its own spellchecker or paragraph
  filler, but those features are provided by other programs that are easy to
  fire off from within vi. Therefore, vi itself is a bit limited, but is able to
  interact with other applications to provide virtually any functionality you
  might want.

  At first, vi may appear to be somewhat complex and unwieldy. However, its
  single-letter commands are fast and powerful once you've learned them. In the
  next section, we're going to describe Emacs, a more flexible editor (really an
  integrated work environment) with an easier learning curve. Do keep in mind
  that knowing vi may be essential to you if you are in a situation where Emacs
  is not available, so we encourage you to learn the basics, as odd as they may
  seem. It should also be added that a number of vi clones are now available
  that are much more comfortable to use than the original vi, the most popular
  of which is vim (vi improved). Chances are that your distribution has things
  set up so that when starting vi, you actually start one of those. We'll stick
  to the basics here, though, so that you can use the information presented here
  no matter which version of vi you use. You can find coverage of the newer
  versions in the book Learning the vi Editor by Linda Lamb and Arnold Robbins
  (O'Reilly).
