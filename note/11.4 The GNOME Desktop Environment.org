  The GNOME desktop environment was conceived in 1999 as an alternative to KDE,
  with its roots in the GPL and LGPL. Like KDE, GNOME had the goal of providing
  modern, easy-to-use applications that work with each other and with existing X
  applications.

  We're going to give you a tour of GNOME the way it commonly looks, but you
  should be aware that it's a general-purpose framework with really unlimited
  flexibility. For example, we show the current window manager, Sawfish, but you
  can install a different window manager with a completely different behavior
  and appearance. The GNOME libraries, as well as the X libraries, underlie all
  the components, and have appeared in command-line and even server-based
  applications as well as the graphical desktop. In addition, the GNOME project
  has developed some powerful applications in typical areas of office work, such
  as spreadsheets and address books. Any X application can run under GNOME
  (although it has to be written with the GNOME framework to use the most
  powerful desktop features, such as the virtual filesystem and themes). In
  particular, a lot of KDE applications work very nicely on GNOME, and vice
  versa.

  Of course, for our purposes, the interesting parts are the core desktop and
  its associated applications. In the next sections, we'll go over the GNOME
  look and feel, talk a little bit about the customization options it offers to
  you, and then give a quick tour of major applications, such as Evolution and
  Gnumeric. But first, you'll want to make sure you have the software and that
  it's up to date.
