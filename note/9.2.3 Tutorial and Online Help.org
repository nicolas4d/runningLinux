  Already Emacs looks a bit complex; that is simply because it's such a flexible
  system. Before we go any further, it is instructive to introduce Emacs's
  built-in online help and tutorial. This documentation has also been published
  in book form as the GNU Emacs Manual, by Richard M. Stallman (GNU Press).

  Using the C-h command gives you a list of help options on the last line of the
  display. Pressing C-h again describes what they are. In particular, C-h
  followed by t drops you into the Emacs tutorial. It should be
  self-explanatory, and an interactive tutorial about Emacs tells you more about
  the system than we can hope to cover here.

  After going through the Emacs tutorial you should get accustomed to the Info
  system, where the rest of the Emacs documentation resides. C-h followed by i
  enters the Info reader. A mythical Info page might look like this:
* 
  As you see, text is presented along with a menu to other "nodes." Pressing m
  and then entering a node name from the menu will allow you to read that node.
  You can read nodes sequentially by pressing the spacebar, which jumps to the
  next node in the document (indicated by the information line at the top of the
  buffer). Here, the next node is Instructions , which is the first node in the
  menu.

  Each node also has a link to the parent node ( Up ), which here is (dir) ,
  meaning the Info page directory. Pressing u takes you to the parent node. In
  addition, each node has a link to the previous node, if it exists (in this
  case, it does not). The p command moves to the previous node. The l command
  returns you to the node most recently visited.

  Within the Info reader, pressing ? gives you a list of commands and pressing h
  presents you with a short tutorial on using the system. Since you're running
  Info within Emacs, you can use Emacs commands as well (such as C-x b to switch
  to another buffer).
* 
  If you think that the Info system is arcane and obsolete, please keep in my
  mind that it was designed to work on all kinds of systems, including those
  lacking graphics or powerful processing capabilities.

  Other online help is available within Emacs. Pressing C-h C-h gives you a list
  of help options. One of these is C-h k , after which you press a key, and
  documentation about the function that is bound to that key appears.
