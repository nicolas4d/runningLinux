  Text editors are among the most important applications in the Unix world. They
  are used so often that many people spend more time within an editor than
  anywhere else on their Unix system. The same holds true for Linux.

  The choice of an editor can be a religious one. Many editors exist, but the
  Unix community has arranged itself into two major groups: the Emacs camp and
  the vi camp. Because of vi's somewhat nonintuitive user interface, many people
  (newcomers and seasoned users alike) prefer Emacs over vi. However, long-time
  users of vi (and single-finger typists) use it more efficiently than a more
  complex editor such as Emacs.

  If vi is one end of the text-editor spectrum, Emacs is the other; they are
  widely different in their design and philosophy. Emacs is partly the
  brainchild of Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation and
  author of much of the GNU software.

  Emacs is a very large system with more features than any single Unix
  application to date (some people would even go so far as not to call it an
  editor but an "integrated environment"). It contains its own LISP language
  engine that you can use to write extensions for the editor. (Many of the
  functions within Emacs are written in Emacs LISP.) Emacs includes extensions
  for everything from compiling and debugging programs to reading and sending
  electronic mail to X Window System support and more. Emacs also includes its
  own online tutorial and documentation. The book Learning GNU Emacs by Debra
  Cameron, Bill Rosenblatt, and Eric Raymond (O'Reilly) is a popular guide to
  the editor.
* 
  Most Linux distributions include two variants of Emacs. GNU Emacs is the
  original version, which is still being developed, but development seems to
  have slowed down. XEmacs is larger, but much more user-friendly and better
  integrated with the X Window System (even though you can also use it from the
  command line, despite its name). If you are not tight on memory and have a
  reasonably fast computer, we suggest using XEmacs. Another advantage of XEmacs
  is that many useful packages that you would need to download and install
  separately with GNU Emacs are already shipped with XEmacs. We will not cover
  the differences here, though; the discussion in this section applies to both.
  Whenever we talk about Emacs in this section, we mean either version.
