So, you've staked out your homestead on the Linux frontier, and installed and
configured your system. What's next? Eventually you'll want to communicate with
other systems — Linux and otherwise — and the Pony Express isn't going to
suffice.

Fortunately, Linux supports a number of methods for data communication and
networking. This includes serial communications, TCP/IP, and UUCP. In this
chapter and the next, we will discuss how to configure your system to
communicate with the world.

The Linux Network Administrator's Guide, available from the Linux Documentation
Project (See Linux Documentation Project in the Bibliography) and also published
by O'Reilly & Associates, is a complete guide to configuring TCP/IP and UUCP
networking under Linux. For a detailed account of the information presented
here, we refer you to that book.
