  There are various ways to move and duplicate blocks of text within Emacs.
  These methods involve use of the mark, which is simply a "remembered" cursor
  location you can set using various commands. The block of text between the
  current cursor location (point) and the mark is called the region.

  You can set the mark using the key C-@ (or C-Space on most systems). Moving
  the cursor to a location and pressing C-@ sets the mark at that position. You
  can now move the cursor to another location within the document, and the
  region is defined as the text between mark and point.

  Many Emacs commands operate on the region. The most important of these
  commands deal with deleting and yanking text. The command C-w deletes the
  current region and saves it in the kill ring. The kill ring is a list of text
  blocks that have been deleted. You can then paste (yank) the text at another
  location, using the C-y command. (Note that the semantics of the term yank
  differ between vi and Emacs. In vi, "yanking" text is equivalent to adding it
  to the undo register without deleting it, while in Emacs, "yank" means to
  paste text.) Using the kill ring, you can paste not only the most recently
  deleted block of text, but also blocks of text that were deleted previously.

  For example, type the following text into an Emacs buffer:

  Now, move the cursor to the beginning of the second line ("Here is a
  line..."), and set the mark with C-@ . Move to the end of the line (with C-e
  ), and delete the region using C-w . The buffer should now look like the
  following:

  In order to yank the text just deleted, move the cursor to the end of the
  buffer and press C-y . The line should be pasted at the new location:

  Pressing C-y repeatedly will insert the text multiple times.

  You can copy text in a similar fashion. Using M-w instead of C-w will copy the
  region into the kill ring without deleting it. (Remember that M- means holding
  down the Alt key or pressing Escape before the w .)

  Text that is deleted using other kill commands, such as C-k , is also added to
  the kill ring. This means that you don't need to set the mark and use C-w to
  move a block of text; any command that deletes more than one character will
  do.

  In order to recover previously deleted blocks of text (which are saved on the
  kill ring), use the command M-y after yanking with C-y . M-y replaces the
  yanked text with the previous block from the kill ring. Pressing M-y
  repeatedly cycles through the contents of the kill ring. This feature is
  useful if you wish to move or copy multiple blocks of text.

  Emacs also provides a more general register mechanism, similar to that found
  in vi. Among other things, you can use this feature to save text you want to
  paste in later. A register has a one-character name; let's use a for this
  example:
  1) At the beginning of the text you want to save, set the mark by pressing the
     Control key and spacebar together (or if that doesn't work, press C-@ ).
  2) Move point (the cursor) to the end of the region you want to save.
  3) Press *C-x x* followed by the name of the register ( a in this case).
  4) When you want to paste the text somewhere, press *C-x g* followed by the
     name of the register,
