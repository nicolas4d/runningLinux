  While using vi, at any one time you are in one of two (or three, depending on
  how you look at it) modes of operation. These modes are known as *command mode*,
  *edit mode*, and *ex mode*.

  After starting vi, you are in command mode. This mode allows you to use a number
  of (usually single-letter) commands to modify text, as we'll see soon. Text is
  actually inserted and modified within edit mode. To begin inserting text, press
  *i* (which will place you into edit mode) and begin typing:

  While inserting text, you may type as many lines as you wish (pressing the Enter
  key after each, of course), and you may correct mistakes using the Backspace
  key. To end edit mode and return to command mode, press the *Escape* key.

  While in command mode, you can use the arrow keys to move around the file.
  Alternatively, or when the arrow keys don't work, you may use *h, j, k, and l*,
  which move the cursor left, down, up, and right, respectively.
* 
  There are several ways to insert text other than using the i command. The *a*
  command (for "append") inserts text after the current cursor position. For
  example, use the left arrow key to move the cursor between the words good and
  men :

  Press a, type wo, and then press Escape to return to command mode:

  To open a line below the current one and begin inserting text, use the *o*
  command. Press *o* and type another line or two:

  Remember that at any time you're either in command mode (where commands such
  as i, a, or o are valid) or in edit mode (where you're inserting text,
  followed by Escape to return to command mode). If you're not sure which mode
  you're in, press Escape. This takes you out of edit mode, if you are in it,
  and does nothing except beep if you're already in command mode.
