  GNU Emacs is simply invoked as:
  #+begin_src shell
    emacs options
  #+end_src
  Likewise, XEmacs is invoked as:
  #+begin_src shell
    xemacs options
  #+end_src
  Most of the time, you don't need options. You can specify filenames on the
  command line, but it's more straightforward to read them in after starting the
  program.

  In Emacs lingo, C-x means Ctrl-X, and M-p is equivalent to Alt-P. As you might
  guess, C- M-p means Ctrl-Alt-P.

  Using these conventions, press C-x followed by C-f to read in a file or create
  a new one. The keystrokes display a prompt at the bottom of your screen
  showing your current working directory. You can create a buffer now to hold
  what will end up being the content of a new file; let's call the file
  wibble.txt.

  The mode line at the bottom indicates the name of the file as well as the type
  of buffer you're in (which here is Fundamental ). Emacs supports many kinds of
  editing modes; Fundamental is the default for plain-text files, but other
  modes exist for editing C and T E X source, modifying directories, and so on.
  Each mode has certain key bindings and commands associated with it, as we'll
  see soon. Emacs typically determines the mode of the buffer based on the
  filename extension.

  To the right of the buffer type is the word All , which means that you are
  currently looking at the entire file (which is empty). Typically, you will see
  a percentage, which represents how far into the file you are.

  If you're running Emacs under the X Window System, a new window will be
  created for the editor with a menu bar at the top, scrollbars, and other
  goodies. In Section 11.6.2 in Chapter 11, we discuss Emacs's special features
  when used within X.
