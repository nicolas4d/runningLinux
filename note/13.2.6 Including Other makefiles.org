Large projects tend to break parts of their makefiles into separate files.
This makes it easy for different makefiles in different directories to share
things, particularly macro definitions. The line:
#+begin_src 
  include  filename
#+end_src
reads in the contents of filename . You can see this in the Linux kernel
makefile, for instance:
#+begin_src makefile
    include .depend
#+end_src
If you look in the file .depend, you'll find a bunch of makefile entries:
these lines declare that object files depend on particular header files. (By
the way, .depend might not exist yet; it has to be created by another entry in
the makefile.)

Sometimes include lines refer to macros instead of filenames, as in:
#+begin_src makefile
    include ${INC_FILE}
#+end_src
In this case, INC_FILE must be defined either as an environment variable or as
a macro. Doing things this way gives you more control over which file is used.
