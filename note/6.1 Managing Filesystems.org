* 
  To Unix systems, *a filesystem is some device* (such as a hard drive, floppy,
  or CD-ROM) that is formatted to store files. Filesystems can be found on hard
  drives, floppies, CD-ROMs, and other storage media that permit random access.
  (A tape allows only sequential access, and therefore can't contain a
  filesystem per se.)

  The exact format and means by which files are stored is not important; the
  system provides a common interface for all filesystem types it recognizes.
  Under Linux, filesystem types include the Second Extended filesystem, or
  ext2fs, which you probably use to store Linux files (also ext3 is slowly
  taking over); the VFAT filesystem, which allows files on Windows 95/98/ME
  partitions and floppies to be accessed under Linux; and several others,
  including the ISO 9660 filesystem used by CD-ROM.
* 
  Each filesystem type has a very different underlying format for storing data.
  However, when you access any filesystem under Linux, the system presents the
  data as files arranged into a hierarchy of directories, along with owner and
  group IDs, permission bits, and the other characteristics with which you're
  familiar.

  In fact, information on file ownership, permissions, and so forth is provided
  only by filesystem types that are meant to be used for storing Linux files.
  For filesystem types that don't store this information, the kernel drivers
  used to access these filesystems "fake" the information. For example, the
  MS-DOS filesystem has no concept of file ownership; therefore, all files are
  presented as if they were owned by root . This way, above a certain level, all
  filesystem types look alike, and each file has certain attributes associated
  with it. Whether this data is actually used in the underlying filesystem is
  another matter altogether.
* 
  As the system administrator, you need to know how to create filesystems should
  you want to store Linux files on a floppy or add additional filesystems to
  your hard drives. You also need to know how to use the various tools to check
  and maintain filesystems should data corruption occur. Also, you must know the
  commands and files used to access filesystems â€” for example, those on floppy
  or CD-ROM.
