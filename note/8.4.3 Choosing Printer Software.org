  In order to print from Linux, you need to install the BSD print system (or an
  alternative system). This provides basic tools, but it does not support modern
  printers. Indeed, it was designed to support line printers (hence the name
  "line printing daemon") and devices common to the computer rooms of the 1960s
  and 1970s. In order to support modern printers, powerful supplemental packages
  provide the features most users think of as essential. (The
  ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org FTP site and its mirrors archive the packages we mention
  here.)

  In this section, we discuss some important packages to support modern print
  services. We assume your system will have at least the groff formatter, the
  Ghostscript page-formatting package, and the GNU Enscript filter packages,
  which are described in Chapter 9. Most Linux distributions already include
  these as well as other formatting and printing utilities. If yours does not,
  you can retrieve them from the usual Linux FTP sites or take them from the CD-
  ROM of another distribution.

  It matters where you get formatting and filtering packages. If you receive
  Ghostscript from a European distribution, for example, it probably defaults to
  an A4 paper format rather than the 8.5x11-inch paper format kept in U.S.
  binary archives. In either case, you can easily override the default through
  an lpr option passed to the filter. Alternatively, you can build the tools
  from source.

  The trend in printer technology is away from character-oriented output and
  toward adoption of a page-description language (PDL) that provides
  sophisticated graphics and font control. By far the most popular of the PDLs
  is PostScript, which has been widely adopted in the Unix and Internet
  communities. A major reason for its acceptance is Ghostscript, a PostScript
  implementation copyrighted by Aladdin Enterprises. A version is also
  distributed under the GNU Public License through the Free Software Foundation,
  along with a large font library that can be used with either version and with
  other PostScript interpreters. Ghostscript is indispensable if you do any kind
  of printing besides character-based output, and it is easily extensible.
* 
  Ghostscript implements almost all the instructions of the PostScript language
  and supports viewer utilities, such as Ghostview, that allow PostScript
  documents to be displayed in an X window. Similarly, excellent filters are
  readily available that convert PostScript output into other printing
  languages, such as Hewlett-Packard's PCL, and into forms printable as raster
  output on inkjet, dot matrix, and laser printers. The Ghostscript package
  supports Adobe Type 1 and 3 PostScript fonts and provides a number of
  utilities for graphics format conversion and filtering. It can even generate
  PDF files â€” i.e., files that conform to the Adobe Portable Document Format
  specification.

  Ghostscript may be insufficient to use by itself, however, because it doesn't
  provide printer control to switch between PostScript and text modes. Although
  Ghostscript does provide a filter that provides this capability (and more),
  the nenscript filter meets the tests of simplicity, flexibility, and
  reliability for most systems, so we document it here. A typical Linux
  formatting and printing system might primarily use groff to format documents,
  creating PostScript output that is then processed by Ghostscript for printing
  and display.
