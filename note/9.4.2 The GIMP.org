  The GIMP (which expands to either GNU Image Manipulation Program or General
  Image Manipulation Program and is often written with the definite article)
  specializes in image manipulation like the ImageMagick package described in
  the last section. But while ImageMagick's strength is batch processing, GIMP
  does everything via its GUI. The GIMP is often cited as one of the most
  impressive and successful products for Linux (and other Unix versions). People
  who use image manipulation programs professionally have said that while GIMP
  can feel a little bit awkward to use, it is functionally comparable to its
  commercial competitor from the Windows and Macintosh world, Adobe Photoshop.
  Some people even have called it "the free alternative to Photoshop."

  GIMP draws its power from an amazing number of plug-ins that are available for
  it. Thus, in order to be able to use a newly written image manipulation filter
  or file format import filter, you only need to install the plug-in and restart
  GIMP, and you are ready to go.

  In addition, GIMP uses a clever tiling mechanism that allows you to load
  arbitrarily large images into it; GIMP will keep in memory only the part that
  is currently being used or visible. And if these features are not enough, GIMP
  also has its own scripting language called script- fu, and can be scripted
  with Perl as well.

  GIMP comes with most Linux distributions on the market today and can be run
  simply by entering the command gimp in a shell after starting X. If your
  distribution does not have GIMP, you can get the source code from
  www.gimp.org. If you plan to do more work with GIMP, you should check this web
  site anyway because it also contains the documentation and sample images that
  show off what you can do with it. A screenshot showing the toolbar, dialog
  boxes, and a work area is shown in Figure 9-5.
