  The most common way to search for a string within Emacs is to press C-s . This
  starts what is called an incremental search. You then start entering the
  characters you are looking for. Each time you press a character, Emacs
  searches forward for a string matching everything you've typed so far. If you
  make a mistake, just press the Delete key and continue typing the right
  characters. If the string cannot be found, Emacs beeps. If you find an
  occurrence but you want to keep searching for another one, press C-s again.

  You can also search backward this way using the C-r key. Several other types
  of searches exist, including a regular expression search that you can invoke
  by pressing M-C-s . This lets you search for something like jo.*n , which
  matches names like John, Joan, and Johann. (By default, searches are not
  case-sensitive.)

  To replace a string, enter M-% . You are prompted for the string that is
  currently in the buffer, and then the one with which you want to replace it.
  Emacs displays each place in the buffer where the string is and asks you if
  you want to replace this occurrence. Press the spacebar to replace the string,
  the Delete key to skip this string, or a period to stop the search.

  If you know you want to replace all occurrences of a string that follow your
  current place in the buffer, without being queried for each one, enter M-x
  replace-string . (The M-x key allows you to enter the name of an Emacs
  function and execute it, without use of a key binding. Many Emacs functions
  are available only via M-x , unless you bind them to keys yourself.) A regular
  expression can be replaced by entering M-x replace-regexp .
