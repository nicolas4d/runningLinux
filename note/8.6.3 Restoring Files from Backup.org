  If you have deleted important system files, it might be necessary to restore
  backups while booting from an emergency disk. For this reason, it's important
  to be sure your emergency disk has the tools you need to restore backups; this
  includes programs such as tar and gzip, as well as the drivers necessary to
  access the backup device. For instance, if your backups are made using the
  floppy tape device driver, be sure that the ftape module and insmod command
  are available on your emergency disk. See Section 7.5 in Chapter 7 for more
  about this.

  All that's required to restore backups to your hard-drive filesystems is to
  mount those filesystems, as described earlier, and unpack the contents of the
  archives over those filesystems (using the appropriate tar and gzip commands,
  for example; see Section 8.1 earlier in this chapter). Remember that every
  time you restore a backup you will be overwriting other system files; be sure
  you're doing everything correctly so that you don't make the situation worse.
  With most archiving programs, you can extract individual files from the
  archive.

  Likewise, if you want to use your original CD-ROM to restore files, be sure
  the kernel used on your emergency disks has the drivers necessary to access
  the CD-ROM drive. You can then mount the CD-ROM (remember the mount flags -r
  -t iso9660) and copy files from there. The filesystems on your emergency disks
  should also contain important system files; if you have deleted one of these
  from your system, it's easy to copy the lost file from the emergency disk to
  your hard-drive filesystem.
