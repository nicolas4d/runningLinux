  In order to fully appreciate (and utilize) the power of TCP/IP, you should be familiar with its
  underlying principles. TCP/IP is a suite of protocols (the magic buzzword for this chapter)
  that define how machines should communicate with each other via a network, as well as
  internally to other layers of the protocol suite. For the theoretical background of the Internet
  protocols, the best sources of information are the first volume of Douglas Comer's
  Internetworking with TCP/IP (Prentice Hall) and the first volume of W. Richard Stevens'
  TCP/IP Illustrated (Addison-Wesley).
  TCP/IP was originally developed for use on the Advanced Research Projects Agency
  network, ARPAnet, which was funded to support military and computer-science research.
  Therefore, you may hear TCP/IP being referred to as the "DARPA Internet Protocols." Since
  that first Internet, many other TCP/IP networks have come into use, such as the National
  Science Foundation's NSFNET, as well as thousands of other local and regional networks
  around the world. All these networks are interconnected into a single conglomerate known as
  the Internet.
  On a TCP/IP network, each machine is assigned an IP address, which is a 32-bit number
  uniquely identifying the machine. You need to know a little about IP addresses to structure
  your network and assign addresses to hosts. The IP address is usually represented as a dotted
  quad: four numbers in decimal notation, separated by dots. As an example, the IP address
  0x80114b14 (in hexadecimal format) can be written as 128.17.75.20.
  Two special cases should be mentioned here, dynamic IP addresses and masqueraded IP
  addresses. Both have been invented to overcome the current shortage of IP addresses (which
  will not be of concern any longer once everybody has adopted the new IPv6 standard that
  prescribes six bytes for the IP addresses â€” enough for every amoeba in the universe to have
  an IP address).
