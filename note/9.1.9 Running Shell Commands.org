The *:!* command allows you to enter the name of a command, which is executed
within vi. For example, the command:
#+begin_src 
:!ls -F
#+end_src
executes the ls command and displays the results on your screen.

The *:r!* command is similar to :! , but includes the standard output of the
command in the buffer. The command:
#+begin_src 
:r!ls -F
#+end_src

If you need to execute a series of shell commands, it's often easier to use the
suspend key (usually Ctrl-Z), provided you're using a shell that supports job
control, such as tcsh or bash.
