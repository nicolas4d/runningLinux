Most of the commands dealing with files within vi are invoked from ex mode. You
enter ex mode when you press the *:* key from command mode. This places the
cursor on the last line of the display, allowing you to enter various extended
commands.

For example, to write the file being edited, use the command *:w* . Typing :
causes you to enter ex mode, and typing w followed by the Enter key completes
the command. The command *:wq* writes the file and exits vi. (The command *ZZ* —
from command mode, without the ":" — is similar to :wq , but checks first if the
file has been changed, and writes it only in this case.)

To quit vi without saving changes to the file, use the command *:q!* . Using :q
alone will quit vi, but only if modifications to the file have been saved. The !
in :q! means to quit vi — and that you really mean it.
