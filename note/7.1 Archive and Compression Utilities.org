When installing or upgrading software on Unix systems, the first things you need
to be familiar with are the tools used for compressing and archiving files.
Dozens of such utilities are available. Some of these (such as *tar* and
*compress*) date back to the earliest days of Unix; others (such as *gzip* and
*bzip2*) are relative newcomers. The main goal of these utilities is to archive
files (that is, to pack many files together into a single file for easy
transportation or backup) and to compress files (to reduce the amount of disk
space required to store a particular file or set of files).

In this section, we're going to discuss the most common file formats and
utilities you're likely to run into. For instance, a near-universal convention
in the Unix world is to transport files or software as a tar archive, compressed
using compress or gzip. In order to create or unpack these files yourself,
you'll need to know the tools of the trade. The tools are most often used when
installing new software or creating backups â€” the subject of the following two
sections in this chapter.
