The hardest thing about maintaining makefiles, at least if you're new to them,
is getting the syntax right. OK, let's be straight about it, make syntax is
really stupid. If you use spaces where you're supposed to use tabs or vice

Always put a *tab* — not spaces — at the beginning of a command. And don't use a
tab before any other line.

You can place a hash sign (#) anywhere on a line to start a comment. Everything
after the hash sign is ignored.

If you put a *backslash* at the end of a line, it continues on the next line.
That works for long commands and other types of makefile lines, too.

Now let's look at some of the powerful features of make, which form a kind of
programming language of their own.
