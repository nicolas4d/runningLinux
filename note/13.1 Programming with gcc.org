  The C programming language is by far the most often used in Unix software
  development. Perhaps this is because the Unix system was originally developed
  in C; it is the native tongue of Unix. Unix C compilers have traditionally
  defined the interface standards for other languages and tools, such as
  linkers, debuggers, and so on. Conventions set forth by the original C
  compilers have remained fairly consistent across the Unix programming board.

  The GNU C compiler, gcc, is one of the most versatile and advanced compilers
  around. Unlike other C compilers (such as those shipped with the original AT&T
  or BSD distributions, or those available from various third-party vendors),
  gcc supports all the modern C standards currently in use — such as the ANSI C
  standard — as well as many extensions specific to gcc. Happily, however, gcc
  provides features to make it compatible with older C compilers and older
  styles of C programming. There is even a tool called protoize that can help
  you write function prototypes for old-style C programs.
* 
  gcc is also a C++ compiler. For those who prefer the more modern
  object-oriented environment, C++ is supported with all the bells and whistles
  — including most of the C++ introduced when the C++ standard was released,
  such as method templates. Complete C++ class libraries are provided as well,
  such as the Standard Template Library (STL).

  For those with a taste for the particularly esoteric, gcc also supports
  Objective-C, an object- oriented C spinoff that never gained much popularity
  but may see a second spring due to its usage in Mac OS X. And there is gcj,
  which compiles Java code to machine code. But the fun doesn't stop there, as
  we'll see.

  In this section, we're going to cover the use of gcc to compile and link
  programs under Linux. We assume you are familiar with programming in C/C++,
  but we don't assume you're accustomed to the Unix programming environment.
  That's what we'll introduce here.

  The latest gcc version at the time of this writing is Version 3.0.4. However,
  the 3.0 series has proven to be still quite unstable, which is why Version
  2.95.3 is still considered the official standard version. We suggest sticking
  with that one unless you know exactly what you are doing.
