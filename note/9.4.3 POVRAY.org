While ImageMagick and GIMP are mainly for manipulating existing images, POVRAY
(the first three letters stand for Persistence Of Vision) is a program for
automatically creating new images. It is a so-called ray-tracer; a program that
computes a scene from some information about which objects should be in the
scene, what their physical and optical properties are, where the light is coming
from, and where the spectator is standing. You describe this to POVRAY in a
programming language of its own.

This brief description should already indicate that using POVRAY is not
something you learn in one afternoon. If you are interested in this program, you
can download it from http://www.povray.org, which is also the first source for
all kinds of POVRAY resources like sample files, documentation, and so on. Since
we cannot give you even a crash course into using POVRAY here, we'll refrain
from attempting this futile task.

If you are interested in POVRAY, though, but find the task of describing your
scenes in a programming language daunting, it might interest you to know that
certain graphic modeling programs can be used with ray-tracers like POVRAY, so
you do not have to create the 3D models completely by hand. One of these
programs is Blender, about which you can find more information at
http://www.blender3d.com.
