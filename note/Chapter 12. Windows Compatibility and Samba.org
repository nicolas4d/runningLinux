  Linux is a remarkably effective operating system, which in many cases can
  completely replace MS-DOS/Windows. However, there are always those of us who
  want to continue to use other operating systems as well as Linux, or at least
  to exchange files directly with them. Linux satisfies such yearnings with
  internal enhancements that allow it to access foreign filesystems and act on
  their files. It can mount DOS/Windows partitions on the system's hard disk, or
  access files and printers shared by Windows servers on the network. Linux can
  also run DOS and Windows applications, using compatibility utilities that
  allow it to invoke MS-DOS or Windows.

  We use the terms MS-DOS and Windows somewhat generically in this chapter to
  refer to any of the DOS-based operating systems coming from Microsoft or those
  compatible with them. These include MS-DOS, PC-DOS, and DR-DOS/Novell DOS (all
  with or without Windows 3.x running on top of them), as well as the various
  Windows versions themselves, no matter whether they build upon a separate DOS
  installation, such as Windows 3.x, or whether they have a DOS kernel built in,
  such as Windows 95/98/ME. Windows NT/2000/XP are different, and some of the
  things described here will not work with them, or will work differently.

  One of the most common reasons for needing to run Windows is that it often has
  better support for new hardware products. If you have installed Windows
  because you need to use a piece of hardware that is supported by Windows, but
  for which there is no Linux driver, do not despair. Although you may have to
  wait a while for it, most mainstream hardware devices that are supported by
  Windows will eventually be supported by Linux, too. For example, Linux drivers
  for USB devices used to be rare and flaky, but now many common USB devices
  work just fine on Linux. You can get updated information about which USB
  devices work on Linux at http://www.linux-usb.org.
