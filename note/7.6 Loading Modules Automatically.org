* 
  The automatic loading of modules is an especially useful feature which is
  implemented by a kernel component called *kmod*. With the help of kmod, the
  kernel can load needed device drivers and other modules automatically and
  without manual intervention from the system administrator. If the modules are
  not needed after 60 seconds, they are automatically unloaded as well.

  *In order to use kmod*, you need to turn on support for it ( Kernel module
  loader ) during kernel configuration in the Loadable module support section.

  Modules that need other modules must be correctly listed in /lib/modules/
  kernelversion/modules.dep, and there must be aliases for the major and minor
  number in /etc/conf.modules. See the documentation from the modules package
  for further information.
* 
  If a module has not been loaded manually with insmod or modprobe, but was
  loaded automatically by the kernel, the module is listed with the addition
  (autoclean) in the lsmod output. This tells you that the kernel will remove
  the module if it has not been used for more than one minute.

  We have gone through quite a lot of material now, and you should have all the
  tools you'll need to build and maintain your own kernels.
