  OK, you have your printer hardware set up and connected. You should collect a
  hardcopy of your resource documents (at least the manpages for the print
  utilities and files described here, and the Printing HOWTO file). Also, it is
  useful to have the technical specifications for your printer. Often these are
  no longer provided when you buy your printer, but you can usually download the
  information you need from an FTP site or a web site operated by the printer
  manufacturer. While you are retrieving such information, look around and see
  if there is documentation (such as a description of printer error messages and
  their meanings) that can help you troubleshoot and manage your printer. Most
  printer manufacturers also offer a technical manual for the printer that you
  can buy. This may or may not be the same volume as the service manual.

  For example, on the Hewlett-Packard web site,
  http://www.hp.com/cposupport/software.html, you can retrieve printer technical
  data sheets; product specs; port-configuration information; PostScript, PCL,
  and HP-GL files for testing your printers (and filters); descriptions of
  printer control sequences you can pass to the printer to control its behavior;
  and documents telling how you can integrate lpd-based printing services with
  HP's JetAdmin package (and thereby with Netware-networked printers as well).

  Now, before starting, take a deep breath; be patient with yourself. Printer
  services configuration is a skill that takes time to develop. If you have
  sufficiently standard equipment and successfully use one of the new-fangled
  printer management utilities to quickly and efficiently install and configure
  printer services, celebrate! Then note that you can probably fine-tune the
  installation for better performance by applying the procedures we describe
  next, and perhaps by using filters and utilities written specifically to
  support all the features of your printer model. If you decide to revise a
  successful printer installation, make sure you take notes on the changes you
  make so that you can find your way back if your changes don't do what you
  expected.
