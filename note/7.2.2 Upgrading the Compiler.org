  One other important part of the system to keep up to date is the C compiler
  and related utilities. These include gcc (the GNU C and C++ compiler itself),
  the linker, the assembler, the C preprocessor, and various include files and
  libraries used by the compiler itself. All are included in the Linux gcc
  distribution. Usually, a new version of gcc is released along with new
  versions of the *libc* library and include files, and each requires the other.

  You can find the current gcc release for Linux on the various FTP archives,
  including /pub/Linux/GCC on ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org. The release notes there
  should tell you what to do. Usually, upgrading the compiler is a simple matter
  of unpacking several tar files as root , and possibly removing some additional
  files. If you don't have Internet access, you can obtain the newest compiler
  from CD-ROM archives of the FTP sites, as described earlier.

  To find out what version of gcc you have, use the command:
  #+begin_src shell
    gcc -v
  #+end_src
* 
  This should tell you something like:
  #+begin_src shell
    Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-suse-linux/2.95.3/specs
    gcc version 2.95.3 20010315 (SuSE)
  #+end_src
  Note that gcc itself is just a frontend to the actual compiler and
  code-generation tools found under:
  #+begin_src shell
    /usr/lib/gcc-lib/ machine / version
  #+end_src
  gcc (usually in /usr/bin) can be used with multiple versions of the compiler
  proper, with the - V option. In Section 13.1 in Chapter 13, we describe the
  use of gcc in detail.

  We would at this point like to warn you not to try newer compilers without
  knowing exactly what you are doing. Newer compilers might generate object
  files that are incompatible with the older ones; this can lead to all kinds of
  trouble. Version 2.95.3 of gcc is, at the time of this writing, considered the
  standard compiler for Linux that everybody expects to find available. When one
  distributor (Red Hat) started to ship a newer version instead (and even that
  newer version was not officially released), users ran into lots of trouble. Of
  course, by the time you read this, another compiler version might be
  considered the standard. And if you feel adventurous, by all means try newer
  versions, just be prepared for some serious tweaking.
