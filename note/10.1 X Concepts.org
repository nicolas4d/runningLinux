  *X is based on a client-server model in which the X server is a program that
  runs on your system and handles all access to the graphics hardware.* An X
  client is an applications program that communicates with the server, sending
  it requests, such as "draw a line" or "pay attention to keyboard input." The X
  server takes care of servicing these requests by drawing a line on the display
  or sending user input (via the keyboard, mouse, or whatever) to the client
  application. Examples of X clients are the now-famous image manipulation
  program GIMP and the many programs coming out of the aforementioned desktop
  environments KDE and GNOME — e.g., the KDE email program kmail.

  It is important to note that X is a network-oriented graphics system. That is,
  X clients can run either locally (on the same system that the server is
  running) or remotely (on a system somewhere on a TCP/IP network). The X server
  listens to both local and remote network sockets for requests from clients.
  This feature is obviously quite powerful. If you have a connection to a TCP/IP
  network, you can log in to another system over the network and run an X
  application there, directing it to display on your local X server.
* 
  Further advantages of X are security (if the user so desires), the modular
  separation of functions, and the support for many different architectures. All
  this makes the X Window System technically superior by far to all other window
  systems.

  The X Window System makes a distinction between application behavior and
  window management. Clients running under X are displayed within one or more
  windows on your screen. However, how windows are manipulated (placed on the
  display, resized, and so forth) and how they are decorated (the appearance of
  the window frames) are not controlled by the X server. Instead, such things
  are handled by another X client called a window manager that runs concurrently
  with the other X clients. Your choice of window manager will decide to some
  extent how X as a whole looks and feels. Most window managers are utterly
  flexible and configurable; the user can select the look of the window
  decoration, the focus policy, the meaning of the mouse buttons when the mouse
  is on the background part of the screen rather than on an application window,
  and many other things by editing the configuration files of the window
  manager. More modern systems even let you configure those aspects over a GUI.
* 
  In order to fully understand the concept of window managers, you need to know
  that the window manager does not affect what the client application does
  within the window. The window manager is only in charge of painting the window
  decoration — that is, the frame and the buttons that let you close, move, and
  resize windows.

  There can be only one window manager on any X server. Theoretically, it is
  even possible to completely do away with window managers, but then you would
  not be able to move windows around the screen; put a hidden window on top; or
  minimize, maximize, or resize windows unless the programs themselves provide
  this functionality.
  
  Let's shortly mention the desktop environments again. A desktop environment
  like KDE and GNOME is a collection of applications and tools with a common
  look-and-feel as well as many other common properties — e.g., the menus of the
  applications could all be set up according to the same concepts. Desktop
  environments on X always need a window manager, as described earlier. Some
  desktop environments provide their own window manager (such as kwin in the KDE
  desktop environment), while others do not have their own window manager. It is
  up to the user to install a window manager of his or her choice.
