  vi is extensible in many ways. Most of the commands we've introduced can be
  generalized to arbitrary regions of text. As we've already seen, commands such
  as d and y operate on the text from the cursor to a move operation, such as $
  or G . ( dG deletes text from the cursor to the end of the file.) Many other
  commands operate on text through a move command in the same way. Using marks
  you can operate on any region of text.

  As we mentioned before, vi is just a text editor; it doesn't have facilities
  for spell checking text, compiling programs, and other such features. However,
  vi executes other programs that you can use to extend the editor. The command:
  #+begin_src 
  :x,y!command
  #+end_src
* 
  executes the named command with the text on lines x through y as standard
  input, and replaces the lines with the standard output of the command. As with
  the s (search and replace) command, other specifications, such as % and $ ,
  can be used for the line numbers. For example, let's say you want to prepend a
  quote character ( > ) to all the lines in a region of text. One way to do this
  is to write a short shell or Perl script (see Section 1.5.4) that reads lines
  of input and outputs those same lines with the quote character prepended. (Or
  use a sed command; there are many alternatives.) You can then send lines of
  text through this filter, which replaces them with the quoted text within vi.
  If the script is called quote, just use a command, such as:
  #+begin_src 
  :`a,.!quote
  #+end_src
  which quotes the region of text between the cursor location and the mark a.

  Be familiar with the various ex commands that are available. The :set command
  allows you to set various options; for example, :set ai turns on auto
  indentation of text. ( :set noai turns it off.)

  You can specify ex commands (such as :set ) to execute when starting up vi in
  the file .exrc in your home directory. (The name of this file can be changed
  with the EXINIT environment variable.) For example, your .exrc file might
  contain:
  #+begin_src 
  set ai
  #+end_src
  to turn on autoindentation. You don't need the : before ex commands in this
  file.

  A number of good tutorials and references for vi are available â€” both online
  as well as in print. Learning the vi Editor is a good place to look for more
  information. If you have Internet access, the comp.editors archives for vi
  contain a number of reference and tutorial documents, as well as interesting
  vi hacks. ftp://alf.uib.no:/pub/vi is the archive home site; it is mirrored at
  cs.uwp.edu and elsewhere. The home of vim on the Web is http://www.vim.org.
