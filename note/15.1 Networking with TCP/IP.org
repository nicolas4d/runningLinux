  Linux supports a full implementation of the Transmission Control
  Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networking protocols. TCP/IP has become
  the most successful mechanism for networking computers worldwide. With Linux
  and an Ethernet card, you can network your machine to a local area network
  (LAN) or (with the proper network connections) to the Internet â€” the worldwide
  TCP/IP network.

  Hooking up a small LAN of Unix machines is easy. It simply requires an
  Ethernet controller in each machine and the appropriate Ethernet cables and
  other hardware. Or if your business or university provides access to the
  Internet, you can easily add your Linux machine to this network.
* 
  Linux TCP/IP support has had its ups and downs. After all, implementing an
  entire protocol stack from scratch isn't something that one does for fun on a
  weekend. On the other hand, the Linux TCP/IP code has benefited greatly from
  the hoard of beta testers and developers to have crossed its path, and as time
  has progressed many bugs and configuration problems have fallen in their wake.

  The current implementation of TCP/IP and related protocols for Linux is called
  NET-4. This has no relationship to the so-called NET-2 release of BSD Unix;
  instead, in this context, NET-4 means the fourth implementation of TCP/IP for
  Linux. Before NET-4 came (no surprise here) NET-3, NET-2, and NET-1, the last
  having been phased out around kernel Version 0.99.pl10. NET-4 supports nearly
  all the features you'd expect from a Unix TCP/IP implementation and a wide
  range of networking hardware.
* 
  Linux NET-4 also supports *Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP)* and
  *Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)*. SLIP and PPP allow you to have dial-up
  Internet access using a modem. If your business or university provides SLIP or
  PPP access, you can dial in to the SLIP or PPP server and put your machine on
  the Internet over the phone line. Alternatively, if your Linux machine also
  has Ethernet access to the Internet, you can configure it as a SLIP or PPP
  server.

  In the following sections, we won't mention SLIP anymore because nowadays most
  people use PPP. If you want to run SLIP on your machine, you can find all the
  information you'll need in the Linux Network Administrator's Guide by Olaf
  Kirch and Terry Dawson (O'Reilly). Besides the Linux Network Administrator's
  Guide, the Linux NET-4 HOWTO contains more or less complete information on
  configuring TCP/IP and PPP for Linux. The Linux Ethernet HOWTO is a related
  document that describes configuration of various Ethernet card drivers for
  Linux.

  Also of interest is TCP/IP Network Administration by Craig Hunt (O'Reilly). It
  contains complete information on using and configuring TCP/IP on Unix systems.
  If you plan to set up a network of Linux machines or do any serious TCP/IP
  hacking, you should have the background in network administration presented by
  that book.

  If you really want to get serious about setting up and operating networks, you
  will probably also want to read DNS and BIND by Cricket Liu and Paul Albitz
  (O'Reilly). This book tells you all there is to know about name servers in a
  refreshingly funny manner.
