As is usually the case, undoing a task is easier than doing it. To disable swap
space, simply use the command:
#+begin_src shell
  swapoff device
#+end_src
where device is the name of the swap partition or file that you wish to disable.
For example, to disable swapping on the device /dev/hda3, use the command:
#+begin_src shell
  swapoff /dev/hda3
#+end_src 
If you wish to disable a swap file, you can simply remove the file, using rm,
after using swapoff. Don't remove a swap file before disabling it; this can
cause disaster.

If you have disabled a swap partition using swapoff, you are free to reuse that
partition as you see fit: remove it using fdisk or your preferred repartitioning
tool.

Also, if there is a corresponding entry for the swap area in /etc/fstab, remove
it. Otherwise, you'll get errors when you next reboot the system and the swap
area can't be found.
