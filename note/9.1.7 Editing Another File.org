To edit another file, use the *:e* command. For example, to stop editing test,
and edit the file foo instead, use the command shown at the bottom of the
following box:

If you use :e without writing the file first, you'll get the error message:
#+begin_src 
No write since last change (:edit! overrides)
#+end_src

At this point, you can use :w to save the original file, and then use :e , or
you can use the command :e! foo , which tells vi to edit the new file without
saving changes to the original. This can be useful if you edit a file and
realize that you have screwed up. You can then use the :e! command; if you don't
specify a filename, vi discards the changes and re-edits the current file.
