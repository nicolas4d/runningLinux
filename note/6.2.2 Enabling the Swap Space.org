  In order for the new swap space to be utilized, you must enable it with the
  swapon command. For example, after creating the previous swap file and running
  mkswap and sync, we could use the command:
  #+begin_src shell
    swapon /swap
  #+end_src
  This adds the new swap area to the total amount of available swap; use the
  free command to verify that this is indeed the case. If you are using a new
  swap partition, you can enable it with a command, such as:
  #+begin_src shell
    swapon /dev/hda3
  #+end_src
  if /dev/hda3 is the name of the swap partition.
* 
  Like filesystems, swap areas are automatically enabled at boot time using the
  swapon -a command from one of the system startup files (usually in
  /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit). This command looks in the file /etc/fstab, which, as
  you'll remember from Section 6.1.2 earlier in this chapter, includes
  information on filesystems and swap areas. All entries in /etc/fstab with the
  options field set to sw are enabled by swapon -a.

  Therefore, if /etc/fstab contains the entries:
  #+begin_src shell
    # device directory type options   
    /dev/hda3 none swap sw   
    /swap none swap sw
  #+end_src   
  the two swap areas /dev/hda3 and /swap will be enabled at boot time. For each
  new swap area, you should add an entry to /etc/fstab.
