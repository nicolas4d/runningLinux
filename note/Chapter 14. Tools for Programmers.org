Many judge a computer system by the tools it offers its programmers. Unix
systems have won the contest by many people's standards, having developed a very
rich set over the years. Leading the parade is the GNU debugger, gdb. In this
chapter, we take a close look at this invaluable utility, and at a number of
other auxiliary tools C programmers will find useful.

Even if you are not a programmer, you should consider using the Revision Control
System (RCS). It provides one of the most reassuring protections a computer user
could ask for â€” backups for everything you do to a file. If you delete a file by
accident, or decide that everything you did for the past week was a mistake and
should be ripped out, RCS can recover any version you want. If you are working
on a larger project that involves either a large number of developers or a large
number of directories (or both), Concurrent Versioning System (CVS) might be
more suitable for you. It was originally based on RCS, but was rewritten from
the ground up and provides many additional features. Currently, another rewrite
from the ground up is taking place; that new tool will be called Subversion. It
remains to be seen, however, whether it will replace CVS. Finally, the Linux
kernel itself uses yet another versioning system, called BitKeeper.
