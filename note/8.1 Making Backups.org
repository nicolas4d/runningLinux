  Making backups of your system is an important way to protect yourself from
  data corruption or loss in case you have problems with your hardware, or you
  make a mistake such as deleting important files inadvertently. During your
  experiences with Linux, you're likely to make quite a few customizations to
  the system that can't be restored by simply reinstalling from your original
  installation media. However, if you happen to have your original Linux
  floppies or CD-ROM handy, it may not be necessary to back up your entire
  system. Your original installation media already serve as an excellent backup.

  Under Linux, as with any Unix-like system, you can make mistakes while logged
  in as root that would make it impossible to boot the system or log in later.
  Many newcomers approach such a problem by reinstalling the system entirely
  from backup, or worse, from scratch. This is seldom, if ever, necessary. In
  Section 8.6, later in this chapter, we'll talk about what to do in these
  cases.
* 
  If you do experience data loss, it is sometimes possible to recover that data
  using the filesystem maintenance tools described in Section 6.1.5 in
  Chapter 6. Unlike some other operating systems, however, it's generally not
  possible to "undelete" a file that has been removed by rm or overwritten by a
  careless cp or mv command (for example, copying one file over another destroys
  the file to which you're copying). In these extreme cases, backups are key to
  recovering from problems.

  Backups are usually made to tape, floppy or CD-R(W). None of these media is
  100% reliable, although tape and CD-R(W) are more dependable than floppy in
  the long term. Many tools are available that help you make backups. In the
  simplest case, you can use a combination of gzip (or bzip2) and tar to back up
  files from your hard drive to floppy or tape. This is the best method to use
  when you make only occasional backups, no more often than, say, once a month.
* 
  If you have numerous users on your system or you make frequent changes to the
  system configuration, it makes more sense to employ an incremental backup
  scheme. Under such a scheme, you would take a "full backup" of the system only
  about once a month. Then, every week, you would back up only those files that
  changed in the last week. Likewise, each night, you could back up just those
  files that changed over the previous 24 hours. There are several tools to aid
  you in this type of backup.

  The idea behind an incremental backup is that it is more efficient to take
  backups in small steps; you use fewer floppies, tapes, or CDs, and the weekly
  and nightly backups are shorter and easier to run. With this method, you have
  a backup that is at most a day old. If you were to, say, accidentally delete
  your entire system, you would restore it from backup in the following manner:
* 
  1. Restore from the most recent monthly backup. For instance, if you wiped the
     system on July 17, you would restore the July 1 full backup. Your system
     now reflects the state of files when the July 1 backup was made.
  2. Restore from each weekly backup made so far this month. In our case, we
     could restore from the two weekly backups from July 7 and 14. Restoring
     each weekly backup updates all the files that changed during that week.
  3. Restore from each daily backup during the last week — that is, since the
     last weekly backup. In this case, we would restore the daily backups from
     July 15 and 16. The system now looks as it did when the daily backup was
     taken on July 16; no more than a day's worth of files have been lost.
* 
  Depending on the size of your system, the full monthly backup might require 4
  GB or more of backup storage — often not more than one tape using today's tape
  media, but quite a few ZIP disks. However, the weekly and daily backups would
  generally require much less storage space. Depending on how your system is
  used, you might decide to take the weekly backup on Sunday night and not
  bother with daily backups for the weekend.

  One important characteristic that backups should (usually) have is the ability
  to select individual files from the backup for restoration. This way, if you
  accidentally delete a single file or group of files, you can simply restore
  those files without having to do a full system restoration. Depending on how
  you take backups, however, this task will be either very easy or painfully
  difficult.
* 
  In this section, we're going to talk about the use of tar, gzip, and a few
  related tools for making backups to floppy and tape. We'll even cover the use
  of floppy and tape drives in the bargain. These tools allow you to take
  backups more or less "by hand"; you can automate the process by writing shell
  scripts and even schedule your backups to run automatically during the night
  using cron. All you have to do is flip tapes. Other software packages provide
  a nice menu-driven interface for creating backups, restoring specific files
  from backup, and so forth. Many of these packages are, in fact, nice frontends
  to tar and gzip. You can decide for yourself what kind of backup system suits
  you best.
