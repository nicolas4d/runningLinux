  As discussed in Section 6.1.5 in Chapter 6, you can use *fsck* to recover from
  several kinds of filesystem corruption. Most of these filesystem problems are
  relatively minor, however, and can be repaired by booting your system in the
  usual way and running fsck from the hard drive. However, it is usually better
  to check and repair your root filesystem while it is unmounted. In this case,
  it's easier to run fsck from an emergency floppy.

  There are no differences between running fsck from floppy and from the hard
  drive; the syntax is exactly the same as described earlier in the chapter.
  However, remember that fsck is usually a frontend to tools such as fsck.ext2.
  On other systems, you'll need to use e2fsck (for Second Extended filesystems).

  It is possible to corrupt a filesystem so that it cannot be mounted. This is
  usually the result of damage to the filesystem's superblock, which stores
  information about the filesystem as a whole. If the superblock is corrupted,
  the system won't be able to access the filesystem at all, and any attempt to
  mount it will fail (probably with an error to the effect of "can't read
  superblock").
* 
  Because of the importance of the superblock, the filesystem keeps backup
  copies of it at intervals on the filesystem. *Second Extended filesystems* are
  divided into "block groups," where each group has, by default, 8192 blocks.
  Therefore, there are backup copies of the superblock at block offsets 8193,
  16385 (that's 8192 x 2 + 1), 24577, and so on. If you use the ext2 filesystem,
  check that the filesystem has 8192-block groups with the following command:
  #+begin_src 
  dumpe2fs  device  | more
  #+end_src
  (Of course, this works only when the master superblock is intact.) This
  command will print a great deal of information about the filesystem, and you
  should see something like:
  #+begin_src 
  Blocks per group:  8192
  #+end_src
  If another offset is given, use it for computing offsets to the superblock
  copies, as mentioned earlier.
* 
  If you can't mount a filesystem because of superblock problems, chances are
  that fsck (or e2fsck) will fail as well. You can tell e2fsck to use one of the
  superblock copies, instead, to repair the filesystem. The command is:
  #+begin_src 
  e2fsck -f -b  offset device
  #+end_src
  where offset is the block offset to a superblock copy; usually, this is 8193.
  The -f switch is used to force a check of the filesystem; when using
  superblock backups, the filesystem may appear "clean," in which case no check
  is needed. -f overrides this. For example, to repair the filesystem on
  /dev/hda2 with a bad superblock, we can say:
  #+begin_src 
  e2fsck -f -b 8193 /dev/hda2
  #+end_src
  Superblock copies save the day. The previous commands can be executed from an
  emergency floppy system and will hopefully allow you to mount your filesystems
  again.
* 
  Recently, so-called journalling filesystems have been introduced in most Linux
  distributions. Examples of these are the ext3 filesystem, the Reiser
  filesystem, and the jfs filesystem. These are less prone to filesystem
  corruption because they keep a log (the "journal") of all changes made.
  Chances are that with these filesystems, you will never need to use any of the
  techniques described here.
