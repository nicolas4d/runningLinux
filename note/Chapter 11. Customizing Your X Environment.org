  X is now running. But that's only half the story. In the last chapter, you
  learned how to set up the X Window System so that it recognizes your graphics
  board and your monitor. While this is clearly necessary, it is of course not
  the whole story. In this chapter, we will explain the other half: customizing
  your X environment. Why is customization important? When working in the X
  Window System, you might want to change your work environment from time to
  time because your work habits have changed, because new and better
  environments are available, or simply because the old one has become boring to
  you. Some of these environments are quite sophisticated. For example, they let
  you start up a program with all the options you want at the press of a key or
  the click of a mouse, they let you drag file icons onto a printer to have text
  printed, and they can do lots of other things that make you more productive in
  your daily work.
* 
  In this chapter, we'll first talk about some very basic aspects of X
  customization and then introduce you to the two most prominent desktop
  environments on Linux: KDE and GNOME. For readers who want to dig deeper or
  need a type of application that is provided with neither KDE nor GNOME, we'll
  then look at a general means of configuring (older) X applications, the X
  resources, as well as some general X applications that run independent of any
  desktop environment.

  Until recently, the problem with using X on Unix systems in general and Linux
  in particular was that nothing was integrated. You would use a window manager
  and a number of X applications, but they would all look and behave
  differently, and operate in a manner that was not integrated. For example,
  drag-and-drop—ubiquitous on Windows or the Macintosh — was hardly heard of on
  Linux, and if it was, it was difficult to find two applications that could
  interact together with drag-and-drop.

  A relatively new category of software, the so-called desktop environment, has
  accepted the challenge to produce a state-of-the-art Unix GUI and tries to
  provide an integrated, consistent desktop where all programs have the same
  look-and-feel, behave the same, and even provide the same menus in all
  applications (to the extent where this is possible).
* 
  Currently, two main desktop environments are available for Linux: the K
  Desktop Environment (KDE) and GNOME. KDE is a little bit older and much more
  advanced with respect to functionality and stability. It aims at making people
  coming from other computing environments feel at home, as well as providing
  long-term Unix users a more productive and friendly work environment. GNOME,
  on the other hand, has put a lot of work into the visual aspects of a desktop
  environment with colorful icons and the like, but it is less stable than KDE,
  and the individual programs are less integrated. KDE is the default
  environment with most distributions, but almost all of them ship both. If
  yours doesn't, this could mean that the distribution vendor is trying to
  decide over your head what to use. We will cover both KDE and GNOME here.
* 
  In Version 8.0 of Red Hat Linux, the appearance for both KDE and GNOME has
  been set to a custom Red Hat theme that makes them much more similar to each
  other. The goal is to provide a single, consistent look and feel for the
  software, regardless of whether they choose KDE or GNOME. That similarity is
  intended to make Red Hat Linux easier to support and to provide it with an
  identifiable appearance, regardless of the destop framework used. In some
  cases, it may even be difficult to tell whether you're running GNOME or KDE.
  If you don't like the new appearance, it's easy enough to change the settings
  back. Very little aside from the settings is different from the software as
  shipped by the GNOME and KDE projects themselves.
