  The first step in adding additional swap is to create a file or partition to
  host the swap area. If you wish to create an additional swap partition, you
  can create the partition using the fdisk utility, as described in Section
  3.1.3.

  To create a swap file, you'll need to open a file and write bytes to it
  equaling the amount of swap you wish to add. One easy way to do this is with
  the *dd* command. For example, to create a 32-MB swap file, you can use the
  command:
  #+begin_src shell
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=1024 count=32768
  #+end_src
  This will write 32768 blocks (32 MB) of data from /dev/zero to the file /swap.
  (/dev/zero is a special device in which read operations always return null
  bytes. It's something like the inverse of /dev/null.) After creating a file of
  this size, it's a good idea to use the sync command to sync the filesystems in
  case of a system crash.
* 
  Once you have created the swap file or partition, you can use the mkswap
  command to "format" the swap area. As described in Section 3.1.4, the format
  of the mkswap command is:
  #+begin_src shell
    mkswap -c device size
  #+end_src
  where device is the name of the swap partition or file, and size is the size
  of the swap area in blocks (again, one block is equal to one kilobyte). You
  normally do not need to specify this when creating a swap area because mkswap
  can detect the partition size on its own. The -c switch is optional and causes
  the swap area to be checked for bad blocks as it is formatted. For example,
  for the swap file created in the previous example, you would use the command:
  #+begin_src shell
    mkswap -c /swap 8192
  #+end_src
* 
  If the swap area is a partition, you would substitute the name of the
  partition (such as /dev/hda3) and the size of the partition, also in blocks.

  If you are using a swap file (and not a swap partition), you need to change its permissions
  first, like this:
  #+begin_src shell
    chmod 0600 /swap
  #+end_src
  After running mkswap on a swap file, use the *sync* command to ensure the
  format information has been physically written to the new swap file. Running
  sync is not necessary when formatting a swap partition.
